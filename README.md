# Path Tracing Visualization Pipeline

This repository contains a set of scripts that setup a virtual network with VPP routers running the [Path Tracing](https://github.com/path-tracing) protocol. The scripts also launch live python programs that process telemetry packets and ingest them into a kafka broker.

For more details explanations on Path Tracing and how the pipeline works refer to [My Master Thesis](https://leonardorodoni.ch/thesis.pdf), which was carried out at [ETH Zurich](https://ee.ethz.ch/) in the [NSG](https://nsg.ee.ethz.ch/home/) toghether with the [Swisscom](https://swisscom.com) Telemetry and Analytics Team led by Thomas Graf. 

Instructions on how to install the required dependencies, docker containers and launch the virtual environment are available below.
